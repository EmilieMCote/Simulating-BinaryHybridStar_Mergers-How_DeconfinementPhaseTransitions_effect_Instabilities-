# Simulating Binary Hybrid Star Mergers Remnants: How Deconfinement Phase Transitions effect Fluid Instabilities 
Goal: To understand how deconfinement phase-transitions effect the evolution of non-axisymmetric fluid instabilities in post-merger remnants. 

Method:
We ran GRHD simulations of differentially rotating stars with the potential to model post merger remnants. We created a few models with varying degrees of differential rotation, as well as mirror models but using an EOS that does not allow for a 'free-quarks' composition to develop.

Analysis:
Although the simulation movies have proved interesting within a certain range of model stability, the gravitational waves produced by these instabilities provide a lot more information.
