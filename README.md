# Simulating-BinaryHybridStar_Mergers-How_DeconfinementPhaseTransitions_effect_Instabilities-
Goal: To understand how deconfinement phase-transitions effect non-axisymmetric fluid instabilities and their gravitational waves. We ran GRHD simulations of differentially rotating stars with the potential to model post merger remnants.
